# we.org_testAutomationSuite
 
I have added for files which is a basic folder structure for Cypress.io
Fixture folder contains 2 files which i have used as test data for automation
Integration/examples folder contains 3 files:
   1) Impact Code.js = This file has test cases which will test the the impact code module of track your impact page.
                       To test this the user should already have a Impact code.
   2) SignUpforgettingmails.js = This file has test cases which will check the Sign Up process for receieving emails from We.org.
   3) TrackYourImpactNavigationBar.js = This file has test cases which will test the top navigation menu items are clickable or no.
   
To run this Project you can import these 4 folders into your project workspace.
Another way is to import or add file these 3 files of Integration/examples to your cypress workspace folder structure Integration/examples and also do the same for fixture files

Once all the folders are added. Open terminal and run npx cypress open command.
